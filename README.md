# Matplotlib & Seaborn Masterclass

This repository provides a structured, professional learning path for mastering data visualization in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn. It is designed to move from fundamentals to advanced visual analytics, culminating in two applied data analysis projects.

The focus is on:
- Clear and intentional visualization design
- Understanding when and why to use each plot
- Building visualizations that communicate insight, not decoration
- Consistent styling and layout across the entire project

## Learning Outcomes

After completing the notebooks in order, you will be able to:

1. Use Matplotlib’s object-oriented API to build precise, clean visualizations.
2. Choose appropriate plot types based on analytical objectives.
3. Use Seaborn to analyze distributions, categorical relationships, and multivariate patterns.
4. Apply consistent visual themes and styling principles to create professional-quality plots.
5. Perform insight-driven exploratory data analysis and communicate conclusions clearly.

## Projects Included

| Project | Focus | Dataset |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Tipping Behavior Analysis** | Behavioral and business insight | Seaborn `tips` |
| **Feature Relationship Analysis** | ML feature understanding and class separability | Seaborn `iris` |

These projects demonstrate both **business reasoning** and **machine learning data readiness analysis**.

## Usage

Work through the notebooks sequentially.  
Each notebook builds on concepts from the previous one.
